# First-React-project
A React.js practice project developed to enhance my frontend development skills as part of my training at JODAYN. This project demonstrates core React concepts including components, props, hooks, and state management. It is built under the guidance of Ihab as part of my continuous learning journey through the frontend roadmap.
